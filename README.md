Rock-Paper-Scissors in Python.

The 'Player' class contain the player name (Rock, Paper, Scissors), and how many times it won.
I used inside the class Dunder methods to add number of the wins, name and wins number are equals.

The 'Battle' class contain which player had won the battle. 
And the class return back name of which player won the battle.

The 'Game' class has contain the 3 player in class attributes. 
There is a method inside the class to add winning numbers to player.
And an other method which player is the first who reached the final score.

The 'ResultVisualization' class show to us the final result of the game.
For the visulaization I used Matplotlib library.
